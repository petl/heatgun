# heatgun

This project is a controller box for a really cheap heatgun I bought from ebay: http://www.ebay.com/itm/401129852165 .
It comes with an 8 pin 'DIN-style' microphone connector (http://www.vetco.net/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=6559), the pinout is on the bottom. 

I will add a bill of materials when I've got the time, it is mostly finished. 

To get a feeling for the box take a look at the photos. 

Pinout:
1: K type Thermocouple + 
2: K type Thermocouple -
3: Standby switch
4: Ground (earth) wire, connected to the steel tube
5: Fan -
6: Fan + (12VDC)
7: Heating element
8: Heating element
